In Node.js, there are several ways to handle sessions, but some methods are more recommended than others.

**Using a library**

The most popular and recommended way to handle sessions in Node.js is by using a library like `express-session`. This library provides a simple and efficient way to manage sessions.

Here's an example of how to use `express-session`:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const session = require('express-session');

const app = express();

app.use(session({
  secret: 'your-secret-key',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true,
  cookie: { secure: false }
}));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  if (req.session.views) {
    req.session.views++;
  } else {
    req.session.views = 1;
  }
  res.send(`You have viewed this page ${req.session.views} times.`);
});
```
**Using a store**

Another way to handle sessions is by using a store like Redis or MongoDB. This approach allows you to store session data in a separate database, which can be more scalable and efficient.

Here's an example of how to use Redis as a session store:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const RedisStore = require('connect-redis')(session);

const app = express();

app.use(session({
  store: new RedisStore({
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 6379
  }),
  secret: 'your-secret-key',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true
}));
```
**Avoid using the built-in `http` module**

While it's technically possible to handle sessions using the built-in `http` module, this approach is not recommended. It's more error-prone and less efficient than using a library or store.

For example, you could use the `http` module to store session data in memory, but this approach has several limitations, such as:
```javascript
const http = require('http');

const sessions = {};

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const sessionId = req.headers['cookie'];
  if (!sessionId) {
    sessionId = Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9);
    res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', `session=${sessionId}`);
  }
  sessions[sessionId] = sessions[sessionId] || {};
  // ...
});
```
This approach is not recommended because it's not scalable, secure, or efficient.

In summary, the preferred way to write sessions in Node.js is by using a library like `express-session` or a store like Redis or MongoDB.

It's a good practice to separate the session configuration into its own file, rather than defining it within the entry page of the website. Here's why:

**Separation of Concerns**

By separating the session configuration into its own file, you're following the principle of Separation of Concerns (SoC). This means that each file or module has a single responsibility, making it easier to maintain, update, and debug.

**Reusability**

If you define the session configuration in a separate file, you can reuse it across multiple routes or applications. This is especially useful if you have multiple entry points or sub-applications that need to share the same session configuration.

**Easier Testing**

Having a separate file for session configuration makes it easier to test your session setup in isolation. You can write unit tests for the session configuration without affecting the rest of your application.

**Organization**

Separating the session configuration into its own file helps keep your code organized. Your entry page or main application file can focus on routing, handling requests, and responses, while the session configuration file can focus on, well, session configuration.

Here's an example of how you could structure your code:

**session.js**
```javascript
const session = require('express-session');

module.exports = session({
  secret: 'your-secret-key',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true,
  cookie: { secure: false }
});
```
**app.js** (or entry page)
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const session = require('./session');

const app = express();

app.use(session);

// Rest of your application code...
```
By separating the session configuration into its own file, you can keep your code organized, reusable, and easier to test.

When it comes to organizing the data within the session file, there are a few best practices you can follow to keep your code clean and maintainable:

**Use a consistent naming convention**

Choose a consistent naming convention for your session variables, such as using camelCase or underscore notation. This will make it easier to read and understand your code.

**Group related data together**

As you mentioned, grouping related data together by object is a good practice. For example, you could have a `user` object that contains properties like `username`, `email`, and `role`.

**Use a hierarchical structure**

Consider using a hierarchical structure to organize your session data. For example, you could have a `cart` object that contains an array of `items`, each with its own properties like `product_id`, `quantity`, and `price`.

**Avoid using overly complex data structures**

While it's tempting to use complex data structures like nested objects or arrays, try to keep your session data simple and easy to understand. Avoid using data structures that are difficult to serialize or deserialize.

**Use a consistent data type**

Try to use a consistent data type for each session variable. For example, if you're storing a user's ID, use a string or integer consistently throughout your application.

Here's an example of how you could organize your session data:
```javascript
const session = {
  user: {
    id: 123,
    username: 'johnDoe',
    email: 'john.doe@example.com',
    role: 'admin'
  },
  cart: {
    items: [
      {
        product_id: 1,
        quantity: 2,
        price: 19.99
      },
      {
        product_id: 2,
        quantity: 1,
        price: 9.99
      }
    ]
  },
  settings: {
    language: 'en',
    currency: 'USD'
  }
};
```
By following these best practices, you can keep your session data organized, easy to understand, and maintainable.

As for how to organize the data within the session file, you can use a combination of objects, arrays, and primitive data types to store your session data. The key is to keep your data organized and easy to understand.

Here's an example of how you could define the session data in a separate file:
```javascript
// session-data.js
const sessionData = {
  user: {
    id: null,
    username: null,
    email: null,
    role: null
  },
  cart: {
    items: []
  },
  settings: {
    language: 'en',
    currency: 'USD'
  }
};

module.exports = sessionData;
```
Then, in your session file, you can import the session data and use it to initialize the session:
```javascript
// session.js
const express = require('express-session');
const sessionData = require('./session-data');

module.exports = session({
  secret: 'your-secret-key',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true,
  cookie: { secure: false },
  data: sessionData
});
```
By separating the session data into its own file, you can keep your code organized and easy to maintain.

Express-session stores its data in a JSON-like format, but it's not exactly JSON. When you store data in a session using express-session, it gets serialized into a string using a format called "JSON-like" or "JSON-compatible".

Here's what happens when you store data in a session:

1. Express-session takes the data you provide (e.g., an object or array) and serializes it into a string using the `JSON.stringify()` method.
2. The resulting string is then stored in the session store (e.g., memory, Redis, or a database).

When you retrieve the data from the session, express-session does the following:

1. It retrieves the stored string from the session store.
2. It parses the string back into a JavaScript object using the `JSON.parse()` method.

So, while express-session stores its data in a JSON-like format, it's not exactly JSON. The main difference is that express-session allows you to store functions and other non-JSON data types, which would not be possible with plain JSON.

Here's an example of how express-session stores data:
```javascript
const session = require('express-session');

app.use(session({
  secret: 'your-secret-key',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true,
  cookie: { secure: false }
}));

// Store some data in the session
req.session.user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 30 };

// The data is serialized into a string and stored in the session store
console.log(req.session); // Output: { user: '{"name":"John Doe","age":30}' }
```
As you can see, the data is stored as a JSON-like string, but it's not exactly JSON.

Here are the basics of express-session:

**What is express-session?**

Express-session is a middleware library for Express.js that allows you to store data about a user's session. A session is a way to store data about a user's interactions with your application, such as their login status, preferences, or shopping cart contents.

**Key Concepts**

Here are some key concepts to understand when working with express-session:

* **Session**: A session is a collection of data about a user's interactions with your application.
* **Session ID**: A session ID is a unique identifier for a session.
* **Session Store**: A session store is where the session data is stored. This can be in memory, a database, or a caching layer like Redis.
* **Request**: A request is an incoming HTTP request to your application.
* **Response**: A response is the outgoing HTTP response from your application.

**Basic Usage**

Here is an example of how to use express-session:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const session = require('express-session');

const app = express();

app.use(session({
  secret: 'your-secret-key',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true,
  cookie: { secure: false }
}));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  if (req.session.views) {
    req.session.views++;
  } else {
    req.session.views = 1;
  }
  res.send(`You have viewed this page ${req.session.views} times.`);
});
```
In this example, we create an Express.js application and add the express-session middleware. We then define a route for the root URL (`'/'`) that increments a `views` counter in the session data.

**Session Methods**

Here are some common methods you can use to interact with the session data:

* `req.session.get(name)`: Retrieves the value of a session variable.
* `req.session.set(name, value)`: Sets the value of a session variable.
* `req.session.delete(name)`: Deletes a session variable.
* `req.session.destroy()`: Destroys the entire session.

**Session Options**

Here are some common options you can pass to the express-session middleware:

* `secret`: A secret key used to sign the session ID cookie.
* `resave`: Whether to resave the session data on every request.
* `saveUninitialized`: Whether to save uninitialized sessions.
* `cookie`: Options for the session ID cookie.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

**Ending a Session**

To end a session, you can use the `req.session.destroy()` method. This method will delete the entire session, including all its contents.

Here's an example:
```javascript
app.get('/logout', (req, res) => {
  req.session.destroy((err) => {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
    } else {
      res.redirect('/login');
    }
  });
});
```
In this example, when the user visits the `/logout` route, the `req.session.destroy()` method is called, which deletes the entire session. The `(err)` callback is optional, but it's a good practice to handle any potential errors that might occur during the destruction process.

**What happens when a session is destroyed?**

When a session is destroyed, the following things happen:

* The session data is deleted from the session store (e.g., memory, database, or Redis).
* The session ID cookie is deleted from the user's browser.
* Any subsequent requests from the user will not have access to the previous session data.

Note that destroying a session does not automatically log out the user or invalidate their authentication credentials. If you're using authentication middleware, you'll need to handle logging out the user separately.

**Alternative: Regenerating the Session**

If you want to keep the session ID cookie intact but clear out the session data, you can use the `req.session.regenerate()` method instead of `req.session.destroy()`. This method will generate a new session ID and clear out the session data, but keep the same session ID cookie.
```javascript
app.get('/logout', (req, res) => {
  req.session.regenerate((err) => {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
    } else {
      res.redirect('/login');
    }
  });
});
```
This approach can be useful if you want to maintain the user's session ID cookie but clear out the session data for security or other reasons.
